  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Legerdemain and Conjuring are words frequently
applied to the same object, but the definitions
of them are quite different.</p>

<p class='c006'>Legerdemain is that which conveys deception
to the eye from philosophical principles, while
Conjuring is nothing more or less than Sleight of
Hand. Simple as the denomination seems from
the title which it bears, many of our first Professors
have applied much of their valuable time
in developing the mysteries of it; and our young
friends may rest assured, that the ascertaining of
the power of mechanism has, in many instances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>emanated from an hour or two’s amusing experiments.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Tricks, Puzzles, Conundrums, &amp;c. which
are now presented, have been selected from the
best works,—some have never yet appeared before
the Public in print. If the perusal of the following
pages, afford one hour’s amusement, the Author’s
wishes will be obtained.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>To make an Egg Tumble.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Put a penny-worth of Quick-silver into a quill, and seal it
at both ends with wax, then boil an Egg, and as soon as you
take it out of the water, put your quill through a small hole
in the narrow end; put the egg on the table, and it will
tumble about as long as the heat remains.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make Fire Flash from Water.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Pour a small quantity of clear water into a glass, and put
a piece or two of phosphoret of lime into it. In a few seconds
flashes of fire will dart from the surface of the water, and end
in curls of smoke rising in regular succession.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To suspend a Ring by a Thread which has been Burnt.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>The thread having been previously soaked in urine, or
common salt and water, tie it to a ring, not larger than a
wedding ring; when you apply a flame of a candle to it,
though the thread will burn to ashes, it will yet sustain the
ring.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To take the impression of Butterflies upon paper.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Clip the wings of the butterfly, lay them upon clean paper in
the form of the insect when flying, spread some thick pure gum
water on another piece of paper, press it upon the wings, and
it will take them up, lay a piece of white paper over it, and
rub it gently with your finger, or the smooth handle of a
knife. The bodies are to be drawn in the space which you
leave between the wings.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>To Gild the edges of Writing Paper or leaves of Books.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Screw a quantity of pages strongly into a press, after
being cut as smooth as possible, size them with isinglass-glue,
mixed up with spirits of wine, and then apply the gold
leaves, when the size arrives at a proper degree of dryness.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To clean Gilt Buckles, Chains, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Dip a soft brush in water and rub a little soap on it, and
brush the articles for a minute or two, then wash it clean,
wipe it and place it near the fire till dry, then brush it with
burnt bread finely powdered.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make Liquid Gold and Silver, for Vellum Painting, Fans, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Grind up gold and silver leaf with gum water or honey,
in a mortar, then wash the gum or honey, and use the powder
that remains with gum water. This may be applied to any
article with a camel’s hair pencil, in the same way as any
other colour.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>How to produce Fire from a Cane.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Split a Chinese rattan, and strike the parts together
when perfectly dry, and they will emit fire like a flint and
steel.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To Gild Silk or Ivory by the action of Hydrogen.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Immerse a piece of white satin, silk, or ivory, in a solution
of nitro-muriate of gold (in the proportion of one part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the nitro-muriate, to three of distilled water) whilst the
substance to be gilded is still wet, immerse it in a jar of hydrogen
gas, and it will soon be covered by a complete surface
of gold.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Glass broken by Air.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Lay a square of glass on the top of an open receiver, and
exhaust the open air. The weight of the external air will
press on the glass, and smash it to atoms.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make luminous writing in the dark.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Fix a small piece of solid phosphorus in a quill, and write
with it upon paper; if the paper be then placed in a dark
room, the writing will appear beautifully luminous.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Incombustible Paper.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Dip a sheet of paper in strong alum-water, and when
dry, repeat the process a second and third time. As soon
as it is dry, you may put it in the flame of a candle, and it
will not burn.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>The Animated Sixpence.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>To make a sixpence leap out of a pot. This is done by
means of a long black horse hair fastened to the rim of a
sixpence, by a small hole driven through it. This feat
should be done by night, with a candle placed between the
spectators and the operator, their eyes being thereby hindered
from discerning the deception.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>Wine upon Water.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Half fill a glass with water, throw a bit of the crumb of a
loaf into it, about the size of a nut, pour some wine lightly
on the bread, and you will see the water at the bottom of the
glass, and the wine floating at the top of it.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To cast figures in imitation of Ivory.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Mix isinglass and strong brandy with powder of egg-shells,
finely powdered, into a paste. Cast it warm into the mould,
which must be previously oiled over; leave the figure in the
mould till dry, and upon taking it out, you will find that it
bears a strong resemblance to ivory.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make a bird appear as if it was dead.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Lay any bird upon a table, and wave a small feather over
its eyes, and it will appear as dead; but by removing the
feather it will revive again. Let it lay hold of the stem part
of the feather with its feet, and it will twist and turn about
like a parrot; you may likewise roll it about on the table at
your pleasure.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>The manner of making Water freeze by the Fireside.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>This feat can only be performed in winter. Place a stool
before the fire, having first put a little water upon the stool;
upon it set a quart pot, then put a handful of snow into it,
having privately conveyed into the pot a handful of salt; stir
it about for eight or ten minutes with a stick, and the congelation
will be effected.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>Engraving in Relief upon an Egg-shell.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Choose an egg that has a thick shell, wash it well in
fresh water, then dry it very carefully with a linen cloth;
melt some tallow or fat, and while very hot, make any figures
or drawings you please with it upon the shell, either with a
pen or pencil. This being finished, take the shell by the two
ends, between two fingers, and then lay it gently in a
tumbler filled with good white wine vinegar, the acid of which
will have eaten enough of the thickness of the shell in about
four hours.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make a party appear ghastly.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>This can only be done in a room. Take half a pint of
spirits, and having warmed it, put a handful of salt with it
into a bason; then set it on fire, and it will have the effect
of making every person within its influence look hideous.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To fill a glass with water in such a manner, that it cannot be removed without spilling it all.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Lay a wager with any one that you so fill a glass with
water that he shall not move it off the table without spilling
the whole contents. Then fill a glass with water, and placing
a bit of paper or thin card over the top, so as to cover the
water and the edge of the glass, you dexterously turn the glass
upside down on a smooth table, and then drawing away the
paper gently, the water will remain suspended in the glass,
and therefore it will be impossible to remove it from the
table without spilling the contents.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>How to make your cup draw your tea out of the saucer.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Empty the tea out of your cup into the saucer; then take
a piece of paper, light it, and lay it on the surface of the tea,
and instantly clap your cup over it, and it will immediately
suck the tea into the cup.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make Touch-Paper.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Dissolve in spirits of wine a little saltpetre; take and wet
with the above some blue paper, and when dry it will be fit
for use.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make a Report like that of a gun with a Tobacco-Pipe.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Before performing this feat you must have a powder made
of the following ingredients in your pocket:—One ounce of
cream of tartar, one ounce of saltpetre, and half an ounce of
sulphur, pulverized singly, and then well mixed together.
Convey a single grain of this powder into a tobacco-pipe,
and when it takes fire it will produce a noise like that of a
gun, without breaking the pipe.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make a sound similar to St. Paul’s Bell.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Tie a poker, or any other piece of metal, on to the middle
of a strip of flannel about a yard long; then press with your
thumbs or fingers the end of the flannel into your ears, while
you swing the poker against any obstacle, as an iron fender,
and you will hear a sound similar to that of a large church bell.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>How to restore a dead fly to life.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Take a fly that has been drowned in water or spirits, place
it in the sun, and cover it with pounded chalk or salt; in a
few minutes it will revive and fly away. It is necessary that
the fly be not squeezed when taken from the water.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To melt a piece of steel as if it was lead, without requiring a large fire.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Make a piece of steel quite red in the fire; then holding it
with a pair of pincers or tongs, take in the other hand a stick
of brimstone, and touch the piece of steel with it; immediately
after their contact, you will see the steel melt and drop like
a liquid.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>How to procure laughter.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Take a ball in one hand and another in the other, then
stretch your hands as far as you can one from the other; and
if any one will lay a wager that you will not withdraw your
hands, and yet will make both of them come into either hand,
which they please, it is no more to do, than to lay one down
upon a table, and turn yourself round, and take it up with
your other hand, then your wager is won; and it will move
no small laughter to see a fool so lose his money.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To tell any number thought of by another person.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Desire the person who has thought of a number to multiply
it by itself; then desire him to add unity to the number
thought of, and to multiply that sum also by itself; in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>last place, ask him to tell the difference of these two
products, which will certainly be an odd number, and the
least half of it will be the number required.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>For Example.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Let the number thought of be 5, which multiplied by itself
gives 25; in the next place, 5 increased by 1 is 6, which
multiplied by itself makes 36; and the difference between
these two squares is 11, the least half of which is 5, the
number thought of.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make Alum Baskets.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Form a small basket, about the size of the hand, of iron
wire; then take some worsted, and wind it round every part
of it. Boil a pound of alum in a quart of water, let it boil
well, stirring it all the time; when completely dissolved,
pour it into a deep pan, and by a thread suspend the basket
into it to a good depth, so as that no part shall touch the
vessel; let it remain for one day, and when you take it out,
the alum will be found crystallized all over the basket. The
alum may be coloured pink, purple, or yellow, by boiling
Brazil, logwood, or French berries with it.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Silver Tree on Glass.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Put a few drops of the solution of silver in aqua-fortis; on
a piece of glass form a bit of copper or brass wire, to represent
a tree with its branches, but flat, so as to lie upon the glass;
lay it in the liquid, and let it remain for an hour or two.
A beautiful vegetation will be perceived all round the wire,
which will nearly be covered by it. This may be preserved
by washing it very carefully with water, and putting another
glass over it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>A person having written an odd number on one card, and an even on another, to tell which is the even and which is the odd.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Desire him to multiply the number in his right hand by 5
(or any odd number) and that in his left by 6, (or any even
number) and tell you if the sum of the products added together
be odd or even. If it be even, the even number is in
the right; but if odd, the even number is in the left hand.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>A Metal which bursts into flame when thrown upon cold water.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Place a piece of potassium, of about two grains weight,
upon cold water in a bason, when it inflames, and exhibits
a beautiful light of a violet red colour.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>The Artificial Spider.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Cut a piece of burnt cork, about the size of a pea, in the
shape of a spider; make its legs of linen thread, and put a
grain or two of lead into it; to give it more weight; suspend
it by a fine line of silk between the arch, and an excited stick
of wax.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make waves of fire on the surface of water.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>On a lump of loaf sugar, let fall a few drops of phosphorized
ether, and place the sugar in a glass of warm water; a very
beautiful appearance will be instantly exhibited: and the
effect is increased if the surface of the water is made to
undulate, by blowing gently with the breath.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>Spoons which melt in hot water.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Melt together, in a crucible, five parts of lead, three of
tin, and eight of bismuth; these metals will contain and form
an alloy (of which spoons may be made, possessed of the
remarkable property of melting in boiling water.)</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To prepare Phosphorized Ether.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Suffer sulphuric ether (about sixpenny worth) to stand for
some weeks over a few small pieces of phosphorus, in a well-stopped
phial. The solution is aided by occasional agitation.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>How to extract sixpence from under a glass without touching it.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Place two shillings at an equal distance, so as to allow the
rim of a glass to rest on them, place a sixpence in the centre
of the shillings under the glass; by drawing your nail along
the table, the sixpence will follow the motion of your nail.
This feat can only be performed on a baize, cloth, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To prepare a luminous Bottle.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Put a piece of phosphorus, the size of a pea, into a phial,
add boiling oil until the bottle is a third full. The phial
must then be carefully corked; and when it is to be used it
should be unstopped, to admit the atmospheric air; the upper
part of the phial will be luminous, and if care be taken to keep
it in general well closed, it will preserve this illuminative
power for six months.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>An excellent feat to win a wager.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Lay any person a bet that you will stick a knife in a beam
of the ceiling, and place a halfpenny underneath, so that by
striking the beam the handle of the knife will fall on the
halfpenny. To perform this feat you have only to fill a glass
with water, and dip the handle in it while it is suspended;
then observe where the water that is on the handle drops on
the floor, place the halfpenny on the spot where it fell, and
it will be sure to be immediately under it.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>How to make Squibs and Serpents.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>First, make the cases, of about six inches in length, by
rolling slips of stout cartridge paper three times round a
roller, and pasting the last fold; tying it near the bottom as
tight as possible, and making it air-tight at the end by
sealing-wax. Then take of gunpowder half a pound, one
ounce of charcoal, one ounce of brimstone, and half an ounce
of steel filings; grind them with a muller, or pound them in
a mortar. The cases being dry and ready, first put a thimble-full
of powder, and ram it hard down with a ruler; then fill the
case to the top with the aforesaid mixture, ramming it hard
down in the course of filling it two or three times; when this
is done, point it with touch-paper, which should be pasted on
that part which touches the case, otherwise it is liable to
drop off.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To produce an Electric Spark from a piece of Brown Paper.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Thoroughly dry before the fire a quarter of a sheet of stoutish
brown paper, place it on your thigh, holding it at the
edge with one hand, while with the cuff of the sleeve on the
other, you must rub it smartly backwards and forwards ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>or fifteen times, if the knuckle be then placed near the paper
it will emit a brilliant spark, accompanied with a snapping
noise; the prongs of a fork similarly placed, will produce
three distinct streams of light. The experiment must of
course be performed in the dark, and the trowsers and coat
be of woollen cloth.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Magic Squares.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>A magic square consists of numbers so disposed that in
whatever way you may add the numbers, which the square
contains, they will give the same amount, whether it be
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>Easy method of Constructing paper Balloons.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Take several sheets of silk paper, cut them like the covering
of the sections of an orange, join these pieces together into
a globular body, and border the opening with a ribbon,
leaving the ends that you may suspend the following lamp:
make a small basket of very fine wire, if the balloon is small,
and suspend it from the following opening, so that the smoke
from the flames of a few sheets of paper wrapped together
and dipped in oil, may heat the inside of it, before you light
this paper, suspend the balloon so that it may, in a great
measure, be exhausted of air, and, as soon as it has been
dilated, let it go, together with the basket, which will serve
as ballast.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>A Lead Tree.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>To a piece of zinc fasten a wire twisted in the form of the
worm of a still, introduce it into the bottle suspended to the
cork. Let the bottle be filled with spring water, with a
small quantity of sugar of lead added. In a few days the
tree will begin to grow, and produce a most beautiful effect.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To place a Lighted Candle under Water without extinguishing it.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Take a glass, and fastening a small bit of wood across the
mouth, stick on it a lighted piece of candle, and, with a
steady hand, convey the glass to the surface of the water, then
push it gently down, and the candle may be seen burning
under the water.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make Detonating Balls.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Half a grain of fulminating silver, is to be wrapped up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>with a hard pea in a piece of tissue paper, this, when thrown
smartly on the ground or when trod upon, explodes with a
loud report.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Invisible Ink.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Mix alum with lemon juice, the letters and characters
written with this mixture are invisible till dipped in water.
If a little aqua-fortis be mixed with the water, the writing
will dry well and not run out of its form when the paper is
wetted.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Blue Ink.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Dissolve a small quantity in a little oil of vitriol, and add
a sufficient quantity of water, in which is dissolved some
gum arabic.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Scarlet Ink.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Dissolve vermillion in gum water.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>A pair of Dice being thrown, to find the number of points on each Dice, without seeing them.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Tell the person who casts the dice to double the number of
points upon one of them, and to add five to it, then to multiply
the product by five, and add to sum produced the number
of points upon the other die. This being done, desire
him to tell you the amount, and having thrown out of it
twenty-five, the remainder will be a number consisting of two
figures, the first of which, to the left, is the number of points
on the first die, and the second figure, to the right, the number
on the other.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><i>For Example.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Suppose the number of points of the first die which is
turned up, to be 3 and that of the other 4, then if to 6, the
double of the points of the first, there be added 5, and the
sum produced, 11, be multiplied by 5, the product will be
55, to which if 4, the number of points on the other die, be
added, 59 will be produced from which if 25 be substracted,
34 will remain; the first figure of which is 3, the number
of points on the first die, and the second figure 4, the number
of the other.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make any number divisible by Nine by adding a figure to it.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>If, for example, the number named be 72.857, you tell
the person who names it, to place the number 7 between
any two figures of that sum, and it will be divisible by 9,
for if any number be multiplied by 9, the sum of the figures
of the product will be either 9 or a number divisible by 9.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To extract Silver out of a Ring, that is thick Gilded, so that the gold may remain entire.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Make a little hole through the gold into the silver, then
put the ring into aqua-fortis, in a warm place, it will dissolve
the silver, and the gold will remain entire.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Light produced by Sugar.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>If two pieces of loaf sugar (about a pound each) are struck
against each other in the dark, a light blue flame, like lightning,
will be produced. The same effect is produced when
a loaf of sugar is struck with an iron instrument.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>Singular Experiment with the Snuff of a Candle.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When a candle is burned so low as to leave a tolerably
large wick, blow it out, a dense smoke will arise, if another
candle be applied to the utmost verge of this smoke, a very
strange phenomena will take place; the flame of the
lighted candle will be carried to the one just blown out,
as if it were borne on a cloud; or, more properly speaking,
like a flash of lightning, proceeding at a slow rate. The
experiment may be performed by blowing out the candle as
often as it is lighted.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Artificial Lightning.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Provide a tin tube that is larger at one end than it is at the
other, and in which there are several holes. Fill this tube
with powdered resin; and when it is shook over the flame of
a torch, the reflection will produce the exact appearance of
lightning.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To cause a brilliant explosion under water.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Drop a piece of phosphorus, the size of a pea, into a
tumbler of hot water; and, from a bladder, furnished with
a stop-cock, force a stream of oxygen directly upon it. This
will afford a most brilliant combustion under water.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>The Fiery Flash.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Pour iron filings upon the flame of a candle, from a sheet
of paper, about eight or ten inches above it, as they descend
in the flame, they will enter into a very vivid scintillating
combustion.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>To split a piece of money into two parts.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Fix three pins in the table, and lay the piece of money
upon them; then place a heap of the flowers of sulphur below
the piece of money, and another above it, and set fire to
them. When the flame is extinct, you will find on the upper
part of the piece a thin plate of metal, which has been detached
from it.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Sympathetic Ink.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Write with the nitro-muriate of gold, and brush the
letters over with muriate of tin in a diluted state. The
writing, before invisible, will now appear of an exquisitely
beautiful purple colour.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>A very easy method of gilding ivory.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Place the figure you mean to gild into a solution of nitro-muriate
of gold. On taking out from the latter, it will be
covered with metallic gold.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>How to make the Constable catch the Knave.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Take a pack of cards and look out the four knaves, lay one
of them privately on the top of the pack, and the other three
on the table, saying, here you see, are three knaves got
together, about no good you may be sure, then lay down a king
by the side of them saying, but here comes the constable and
catches them together. Oh, oh, says he, have I caught you
then together? Well the next time I catch you together I’ll
punish you severely for your rogueries. Oh, but, says they,
you shan’t catch us together in haste; so they determine to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>go three different ways. I’ll go here, says one, (so take
one of the knaves and put him at the top of the cards.) I’ll
go here, says another, (so put him at the bottom.) And I’ll
go here, says a third, (so put him exactly in the middle.)
“Nay,” says the constable, “if you run I’ll make sure of one,
so I’ll follow the first, then take the king and put him at the
top of the pack, and let any one cut the cards three or four
times, and then deal; cut the cards one by one, and you will
find three together, and the constable with them.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To tell the amount of the Numbers of any two Cards drawn from a common Pack.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Let the person who has drawn the two cards deduct the
number of each of them from twenty-six, which is half the
number of the pack, and after adding the remainder together,
let him tell you the total, which you privately deduct from
fifty-two, the number of cards in a perfect pack, and the
remainder will be the amount of the two cards.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Example.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Suppose the two cards drawn are 5 and 8; then the person
deducting 5 from 26, there remain 21; then 8 from 26
there remain 18; these two remainders added together make
39, which you substract from 52, and there remain 13 the
number of the two cards when added together.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To tell the number of Cards by their weight.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Take a parcel of cards, suppose forty, among which insert
two long cards, let the first be, for example, the tenth, and
the other the fourteenth from the top; seem to shuffle the
cards, and then cutting them at the first long card, poise
those you have cut off in your left hand, “there should be
here ten cards.” Cut them again, at the second long card,
and say, “there are only four cards.” Then weighing the
remainder, you say, “here are only twenty-eight cards.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c007'><i>To hold four Knaves, or four Kings, in your hand, and to change them suddenly into Blank Cards, and then into four Aces.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>You must have cards made for the purpose of this feat,
half cards, as they may be properly termed, that is, one
half kings or knaves and the other half aces. When you lay
the aces one over the other, nothing but the kings or knaves
will be seen. Then turning the kings or knaves downwards,
the four aces will be seen. You must have two perfect cards,
one a king or knave to cover one of the aces, or else it will
be seen; and the other an ace to lay over the kings or knaves.
When you wish to make them all blank cards, lay the cards
a little lower, and by hiding the aces they will all appear
white on both sides. You may then ask the company which
they choose, and exhibit kings, aces, or blanks, as required.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Cards in couples.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Select any twenty cards, and having them shuffled by any
person that pleases, lay them in pairs upon the table, then
desire several persons (as many as there are pairs on the
table) to look at different pairs, and remember what cards
compose them. You then take up the cards in the order in
which they have been placed, and replace them with their
faces uppermost upon the table, according to the situation of
the letters in the following word.</p>

into the bottle, so that the bent part may rest against its
side, and you may take the other end in your hand, and lift

<h3 class='c007'><i>How to produce Flashes of Light resembling the Will O’ Wisp.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Take a small quantity of water in a glass tumbler, and

<h3 class='c007'><i>Method of cleaning Playing Cards.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Nothing soils sooner than playing cards. The following
method will be found to remove every thing from them
but a stain, and will give the dirtiest pack possible the
appearance of being new. Rub the soiled card with
a piece of flannel and some good fresh butter, until the
butter shall have cleaned off all the dirt. So soon as the dirt
is removed, wipe off the butter with a clean rag, and to
restore the cards to its former gloss, rub the surface sharply
with a piece of flannel and some flour, cut the edges neatly
with a pair of scissars, and the operation is completed.</p>

forming a real fountain of fire.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make an Exploding Bubble.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>If you take up a small quantity of melted glass with a tube
(the bowl of a common tobacco-pipe will do) and let a drop
fall into a vessel of water, it will chill and condense with a
fine spiral tail, which being broken the whole substance will
burst with a loud explosion, without injury either to the party
that holds it, or to him who breaks it; but if the thick end

which is to be placed in the sun, in such a manner
that its rays may pass through the spaces cut out of the paper,
and fall on the surface of the liquor. The part of the
glass through which the rays pass will turn black, and that

no deception, you slip the curtain ring in its stead, and while
the person is eagerly holding the handkerchief, and the company’s
eyes are fixed upon the form of the shilling, you
seize this opportunity of putting it into a hat or basket; when
you get possession of the handkerchief again you slip away

<p class='c008'>Take half an ounce of sal ammoniac, one ounce of camphor,
and two ounces of aqua-vitæ, put them into an earthen pot,
narrowing towards the top, and set fire to it. The effect
will be so alarming, that persons in the room will fancy their
garments are on fire.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To make Artificial Fire Balls.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Put thirty grains of phosphorus into a florence flask, with
three or four ounces of water; place the vessel over a lamp,
and give it a boiling heat. Balls of fire will soon be seen to
issue from the water, after the manner of an artificial firework,
attended with the most beautiful vibrations of light.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To break a Staff placed upon two Glass Goblets full of water, without Injuring the Glasses or Spilling the Water.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Place the glasses (being full of water) upon two joint
stools, equally distant from the ground, and from one another
the length of the staff, then place the ends of the staff upon
the edges of the two glasses, so that they be sharp, this
being done, strike the staff in the middle, with all the force
you can, with another staff, and it will break without injuring
the goblets, or spilling the water.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><i>To observe an Eclipse of the Sun without injury to the Eye.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Take a spectacle glass that magnifies very much, hold it
before a book, twice the distance of its focus, and you will
see the round body of the sun, and the manner in which the
moon passes between the glass and the sun, during the whole
eclipse.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Invisible Ink.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Take zaffer, and dissolve it in nitro-muriatic acid, till
the acid extracts all the metallic part, then dilute the solution
with common water, if you write with this liquid on paper,
the writing will appear of a beautiful green, upon being partially
warmed before the fire.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Bronze for casting Busts, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Melt in a crucible, seven ounces of pure copper, when
fused throw into it three ounces of zinc, and two ounces of
tin. These metals will combine forming bronze, an alloy,
which, from the exactness of the impression which it takes
from a mould, has, in ancient and modern times, been generally
used in the formation of busts, medals, and statues.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To put a Ring through your Cheek and then to bring it on a Stick.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>You must have two rings exactly alike, one of which has
a notch which admits your cheek. When you have exhibited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the perfect ring, you change it for the other, and privately
slip the notch over one side of your mouth, in the meantime
you slip the whole ring on your stick, hiding it with your
hand, then desire some one to hold the end of the stick,
whip the ring out of your cheek, and smite with it instantly
upon the stick, concealing it, and whirling the other ring,
which you hold your hand over round about the stick.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>To tell, by a Watch Dial, the hour when a person intends to rise.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>The person is told to set the hand of his watch at any
hour he pleases, which hour he tells you, and you add in
your mind twelve to it. You then desire him to count privately
the number of that addition on the dial, commencing
at the next hour to that at which he intends to rise, and
including the hour at which he has placed the hand, which
will give you the answer.</p>

    <div><i>For Example.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A intends to rise at 6 (this he conceals to himself) he
places the hand at 8, which he tells B, who, in his own
mind, adds 12 to 8, which makes 20. B then tells A to
count 20 on the dial, beginning at the next hour to that at
which he proposes to rise, which will be 7, and counting
backwards, reckoning each hour as 1, and including in his
addition the number of the hour hand is placed at, the addition
will end at 6, which is the hour proposed; thus,</p>
